    <p>
        Coffee's journey from a luxury item to an everyday staple 
        is a story of globalization, technological advances, and 
        cultural shifts. In its early days, coffee was considered 
        a precious commodity, often reserved for the elite. 
        Originating in the Arab world, it spread to Europe in the 
        17th century, where coffeehouses became centers of social and 
        intellectual life. These establishments were frequented by 
        artists, writers, and politicians, and the drink itself was 
        often associated with sophistication and high society. The 
        limited availability and high cost of coffee kept it out of 
        reach for the average person, maintaining its status as a 
        symbol of wealth and privilege.

        The democratization of coffee began in the 18th and 19th 
        centuries with the expansion of coffee plantations in colonies 
        across the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The increased production 
        and more efficient trade routes made coffee more accessible and 
        affordable. Innovations in roasting and brewing technology also 
        played a significant role, allowing coffee to be produced and 
        consumed more easily. The rise of the Industrial Revolution 
        further boosted coffee's popularity as workers sought a stimulant 
        to help them endure long hours. Coffee began to lose its elitist 
        aura, becoming a part of everyday life for the working class.

        The 20th century cemented coffee's place as a beloved beverage 
        for the masses. The introduction of instant coffee made it even 
        more convenient, while the post-World War II economic boom saw 
        the proliferation of coffee shops and diners where anyone could 
        grab a cup of joe. Cultural phenomena such as the American diner 
        and the Italian espresso bar contributed to coffee's ubiquity. 
        Today, specialty coffee culture celebrates the beverage's diverse 
        origins and complex flavors, making it accessible to both connoisseurs 
        and casual drinkers alike. From the bustling street corners of major 
        cities to quiet suburban kitchens, coffee has transcended its origins 
        as a high-status commodity to become a universal comfort and pleasure.
